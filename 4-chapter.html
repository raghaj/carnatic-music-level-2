<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vina Kuppayyar was the most distinguished disciple of Tyagaraja. He is looked upon as one of	the expert Musicians and composers of the 19th cent. He is the composer of many tana varnas, kritis and	tillanas. He was born in Tiruvottiyur, a place 6 miles north of Madras. He was known as Tiruvottiyur Kuppayyar and Narayanagaula Kuppayyar. The last name was given to him because of his great proficiency in singing the alapana of that raga. His ata tala varna in this is a scholarly composition and ranks with the ata tala varnas of Pallavi Gopalayyar.
Kuppayyar was a Tamizh Brahmin of the Vadama sect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He was born in Bharadhvaja Gotram. His father Sambamurti Sastri was a great Musician. Kuppayyar acquired great knowledge in Sanskrit, Telugu and Music at a very early age. He was also a good vina and violin vidwan. When his father took him to Tyagaraja and placed him under his care, he was also well advanced in the theory and art of	Music. It is said that Tyagaraja took special care in teaching Kuppayyar. Kuppayyar was the Musician in the samsthana of Kovur and enjoyed the patronage of Sundara Mudaliyar. He was honoured with the title Gana-chakravarti. Kuppayyar was a great bhakta of Sri Krishna and was in the habit of performing puja every day. He also conducted festival twice a year and it was during these two occasions that great Musicians came to his house and performed. Due to his great devotion to Sri Krishna, he signed his compositions with the mudra Gopaladasa.
Apart from his kritis and varnas, he had composed two group Kritis entitled Venkatesa pancharatna and Kalahastisa-pancharatna.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his kritis he has adopted the style of Tyagaraja.</p>

<p>It was due to the invitation of Vina Kuppayyar that Tyagaraja visited his native village Tiruvottiyur. When Tyagaraja approached the shrine of Tripurasundari, he was captivated by the holy presence of the deity and composed the famous Tiruvottiyur-pancharatnas.
A few years after Tyagaraja’s visit, a son was born to Kuppayyar and so he was given the name of the great composer. Later he came to be called Tiruvottiyur Tyagaraja. Kuppayyar’s skill as a vainika is revealed in his compositions. His varnas take the highest rank among the varnas of today. His kritis as adorned with suitable and beautiful chhittasvaras.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vina Kuppayyar visited Mysore about the year 1856 during the reign of Sri Krishnaraja Wodayar III (1757-1863). His brilliant kriti in Begada raga, Rupaka tala, ‘Inta parakelanamma’ was composed in praise of Sri Chamundeswari of Mysore. This Kriti contains a figured chittasvara.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vina Kuppayyar became familiar with Western Music by listening to the performance of the European band played from Fort St.George, Madras. The last ettugada svara of his varna ‘Inta chauka’ in Bilahari raga testifies to his familiarity with Western Music.
Kuppayyar  had  many  disciples,  among  whom  are  Kottavasal  Venkataramayyar,  Fiddle Ponnuswami and Pallavi Sitaramayya.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the later part of his life, Kuppayyar came and settled down in Madras. His house became a Musical centre and many Musicians and composers derived great inspiration by visiting him and coming into contact with him. He was solely responsible for making Madras a seat of Musical culture.</p>

<h3 id="_4_2tiruvottiyur_tyagayyar">4.2	TIRUVOTTIYUR TYAGAYYAR</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar was the son and disciple of Vina Kuppayyar. He was born in 1865 A.D.	Vina Kuppayyar named his son Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar named after his guru Sadguru Tyagarajaswamy as Tyagayyar was born after Tyagarajaswamys visit to his home. Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar became also a famous Musician and composer like his father Vina Kuppayyar. He was proficient both in Music and	lyric. Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar composed kritis in 108 ragas and published in a work called ‘Sangita	Ratnavali’. Also, he published his father Vina Kuppayyars compostions in another book entitled ‘Pallavi	Svarakalpavalli’. This is considered as a very great contribution to the Music world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar continued all the Musical services that were rendered by his father Vina
Kuppayyar. He conducted several festivals and maintained his home like a temple of Music and arts. Many Vidwas used to visit his home and perform concerts there. Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar worshipped his father’s guru i.e., Tyagarajaswamy with great respect. He composed a kriti ‘Tyagaraja Sadguru dalatu’ in the raga Kharaharpriya.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar composed the fourth avarta of the Atatala Varna Mukatayi Svara in ‘Sarijanana’ which could not be done by any contemporary Musician. Hence Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar was honoured with the title ‘Svarasimhudu’. Tyagayyar was also called ‘Svarasimha Tyagayyar’ as he was proficient in singing Svarakalpanas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other compostions of Tiruvottiyur Tyagayyar include many Varnas, ragamamalikas in Janaka Janya ragas and rare ragas also. Some of his prominent compositions are:</p>

<h3 id="_4_3patnam_subrahmanya_ayyar_1845_1902">4.3	PATNAM SUBRAHMANYA AYYAR (1845-1902)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Patnam Subramanya Ayyar belongs to the sishyaparampara of Tyagaraja. He was a leading	Musician and a brilliant composer. He was a Tamizh Brahmin and belonged to the Asthasaharam	sect. He was born in 1845 in Tanjavur. His father was Bharatam Vaidyanatha Ayyar. His grandfather was Panchananda Sastri, a court vidwan of Sarabhoji Maharaja. Patnam Subramanya Ayyer hailed from a well-known family of Musicians and scholars who were also adept in Bharata Sastra. Patnam Subramanya Ayyar first learnt Music under his uncle, Melattur Ganapati Sastri. Afterwards, he mastered the art under the tutelage of Manambuchavadi Venkatasubba Ayyer, a direct disciple of Tyagaraja.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Patnam Subramanya Ayyar’s voice was somewhat hard and unresponsive. But he sang to sthayi-	sruti. By dint of hard practice and patient voice culture, he brought his voice to a fine degree of perfection.
He commenced his professional career when he was 30. He got married in his 32nd year. Later he came to Tiruvaiyar and settled there. He was invited by Zamindars, Kings and other rich people and was honoured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In rendereing Tyagaraja’s Kritis with beauty and bhava, he had no equal. They were true to their original versions. He had remarkable gifts of improvisation. He could sing even rare ragas elaborately. He was an exponent of Tana and Pallavi. His concerts were aural feasts. His rendereings of brigas with unusual ease in the tara sthayi was attractive. His beautiful rava jatis, his tanas of variegated patterns and his kalpana svaras of rare originality left a deep impression on all those who heard his concerts.
Patnam Subramanya Ayyar was a great lakshana-lakshya vidwan. He was well versed in the tala system of Karnataka Music. He attained immortal fame by singing Pallavi in Simhanandana tala.
He has an inimitable style of rendering the raga, Begada. This earned for him the title Begada Subramanya Ayyar. Once he had an occasion to perform before the royalty of Mysore. On the first day he sang Begada raga extensively and on the second day he rendered tana in the same raga elaborately and followed it up with pallavi and kalpana svara on the third day. It was an unforgettable performance. On another occasion, before the Mysore royalty, at the request of rasikas he sang elaborately the raga Kannadagaula and followed it up with a Pallavi. The King honoured him with Todas for both his hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He was also honoured by Maharaja Ananda Gajapati of Vijayanagaram, Mysore, Travancore, Vijayanagara and Ramanathapuram courts.
Later in his life he composed kritis, tana varnas, pada varnas, tillanas and jhavalis. His kritis reflect the style of Tyagaraja. Therefore he was called Chinna-Tyagaraja. He composed kritis in Telugu, Sankrit and Tamizh. The sangatis adorning his compositions are noteworthy. He usually sang only the kritis of Tyagaraja in his concert. If anybody requested his to sing his own kritis, he sang one or two towards the close of his concerts. He adopted the signature Venkatesa in his compositions. In some of his kritis he used the mudras, Adi Venkatesa, Sri Venkatesa and Varada Venkatesa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He has composed about 100 pieces inclusive of tana varnas, padavarnas, kritis, javalis and tillanas. Most of them are in Telugu and a few in Sankrit. He has composed many songs in Adi, Desadi, Rupaka, Chapu and Jhampa talas. His kritis like ‘Nipadamule’ (Bhairavi raga), ‘Ninnu Juchi’ (Saurastra raga), ‘Marivere  dikkevarayya’  (Shanmukhapriya)  are  splendid  compositions  and  stand  as  monuments to his creative genius. Kadanakutuhalam is a raga conceived by his genius. He might have got the clue for this raga from the song in Kutuhala raga composed by his guru. Both the ragas are janyas of Dhirasankarabharana. Arohana and avarohan of Kutuhalam is srmndpns – sndpmgrs; that of	Kadanakutuhalam srmdngaps-sndpmgrs. The song ‘Raghuvamsa sudhambudhi’ in this raga has an attractive tune.
Maha Vaidyanatha Ayyar and Patnam Subrahmanya Ayyar were good friends. Both of them lived in Tiruvaiyaru. These two great vidwans used to participate in the bhajanas during the famous Saptasthana utsavam. Pandidurai Tevar requested Patnam Subramanya Ayyar to teach Music to Puchi Srinivasa Ayyangar and made arrangements for the same.
Patnam Subramanya Ayyar was a born teacher of Music. He loved his disciples. He would teach them the art with infinite patience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the request of Salem Minakshi, he came to Madras to teach Music to her two daughters. He stayed in Madras for 12 years and therefore he came to be called Patnam Subramanya Ayyar. Once while in Madras he was staying in the house of a friend in Tiruvallikkeni. One morning he sat near a pillar in the hall of the house and carried on hos nabhi-tana sadhakam. The pitch of his voice accidentally coincided with the frequency of the hall and the pillar and the floor began to vibrate in sympathy. The inmates of the house got frightened and requested the vidwan to stop practicing. The intensity of his Music was such that it excited the sympathetic vibration of the pillar and the floor.
Patnam Subramanya Ayyar was an upasaka of Lord Ganapati and used to perform the festival of Vinayaka Chaturthi with great éclat. As he had no children, he adopted his sister’s grandson. He passed away in Tiruvaiyaru on 31st July 1902.</p>
